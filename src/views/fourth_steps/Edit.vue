Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes. <strong>Where had we been selfish, dishonest, self-seeking and frightened? </strong> Though a situation had not been entirely our fault, we tried to disregard the other person involved entirely. Where were we to blame? The inventory was ours, not the other manâ€™s. When we saw our faults we listed them. We placed them before us in black and white. We admitted our wrongs honestly and were willing to set these matters straight. <br> <small>(BB pg. 67)</small></p>

                  <p>We reviewed our fears thoroughly. We put them on paper, even though we had no resentment in connection with them. We asked ourselves why we had them. Wasnâ€™t it because self-reliance failed us? Self reliance was good as far as it went, but it didnâ€™t go far enough. Some of us once had great self-confidence, but it didnâ€™t fully solve the fear problem, or any other. When it made us cocky, it was worse. Perhaps there is a better wayâ€”we think so. For we are now on a different basis; the basis of trusting and relying upon God. We trust infinite God rather than our finite selves. We are in the world to play the role He assigns. Just to the extent that we do as we think He would have us, and humbly rely on Him, does He enable us to match calamity with serenity. We never apologize to anyone for depending </p>
